= GNU Screen configuration (.screenrc) file with image

= What for?
	To keep the history of my .screenrc
	
= Why?
	Tired of looking for a good hardstatus line or configuration to screen 
	without see how actually it looks like I thought it was a good idea 
	to have a personal repo to add my current .screenrc with an image of 
	how it looks like and here is.
